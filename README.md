1.Bank Misr Project (ATM):
This project's aim was to cluster the closest ATMs using clustering algorithms for many business purposes, like Recommending the closest ATM 
for customers who have experienced ATM cash out, offering the shortest path for the bank's truck filling the ATM to save cost and money, and 
for business management decision support.
2.Bank misr project (Medical insurance):
The goal of this analysis is to use patient data to estimate the average medical care expenses 
for such population segments. These estimates can be used to create actuarial tables that set the price of yearly 
premiums higher or lower, depending on the expected treatment costs.
3.Gan project:
we were required to create and train a Deep Convolutional
Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate faces using the CelebA dataset.
The dataset contains more than 200,000 photos of celebrity faces.
